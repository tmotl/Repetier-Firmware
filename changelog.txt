V RF.01.37p5.TDMod (2017-07-04)
- Fixed theoretical ZOS error with g_abortZScan, because when it is set by function of ZOS the function of HBS will abort without being active.

V RF.01.37p4.TDMod (2017-06-30)
- Improved repeating messurements within ZOS when the digits get disturbed somehow (Filament, Vibrations,...). ZOS is now much more robust against moving idle pressures.
- Test: Round Z-Slow-Steps to even Microsteps.

V RF.01.37p3.TDMod (2017-06-30)
- Tracing some ZOS-Bug with Filament
- Cleanup
- Fixed Bug in SchraubenJustierHelper: Da wurden bei der Abgrenzung mm mit Mikrometer verwechselt.

V RF.01.37p2.TDMod (2017-06-27)
- Fixed some details within ZOS-Scan
- Screw-Offset-Helper is now displaying its suggestions to the Printers display

V RF.01.37p.TDMod (2017-06-27)
- homing is now split into 3 axes
- homing Z only with Tipdown/Positive Matrix activated now might home Y first to avoid crash. This is experimental. This is not protecting the nozzle/bed very good.
- Small Z-Compensation Fix for TipDown-Support
- Tipdown for T1 is now adjustable within Menus Configuration -> Z-Configuration -> Extruder T1 TipDown -> +-
- activating Z-Compensation with only one axis homed is impossible now.
- whenever some axis is homed it is now shown with a * within menu.
- small cleanup

V RF.01.37o.TDMod (2017-06-20)
- Third Z-Scale: G-Code.
- Some small tweaks and comment updates to Tipdown-Support
- Tweaks on Function-Timers in Commands::checkForPeriodicalActions()
- Removed Feature FEATURE_BEDTEMP_DECREASE (My first thing, didnt ever use it again.)

V RF.01.37n2.TDMod (2017-06-20)
- Fanspeed of INT(1) is now 1% in Display (instead of 0%)
- Fanspeed of INT(1) is now sent to Repetier-Server as INT(2) to produce 1% instead of 0%
- printTemperature is now selfcontrolling the outputfrequency (<1Hz), this made some code smaller and easier.

V RF.01.37n.TDMod (2017-06-18)
- Faster Temperature Management for cleaner PID.
- Autosend Temperature-Info 
- major cleanup
- still investigating for "the bug" -> I guess it is gone but I am still testing.

V RF.01.37m5.TDMod (2017-06-18)
- tempered a whole lot with interruptstuff and watchdog

V RF.01.37m4.TDMod (2017-06-10)
- removed some interrupt-blocking in order to accidently unblock them afterwards. there is some bug in this firmware somewhere after 01.37k4 I am now investigating closely.

V RF.01.37m3.TDMod (2017-06-10)
- did some cleanup
- tested some stuff
- changed autotunePID a bit, according to https://github.com/repetier/Repetier-Firmware/commit/241c550ac004023842d6886c6e0db15a1f6b56d7 . Temperatures not unmonitored/unprinted while testing anymore.

V RF.01.37m2.TDMod (2017-05-19)
- Tested and fixed some stuff: monitor temp possible overflow
- changed UI_ACTION_TOPMENU to avoid mod menü when jumping back. commented UI_ACTION_TOPMENU at definition.
- activated free ram debugging
- removed Z_PAUSE_RETRACT_MM from Output-Object until I find out how to concat preprocessor strings, this doesnt really work as supposed since 1.37l2.
- Killed SKIP_M109_IF_WITHIN and put TEMP_TOLERANCE in that place to standarize that. 

V RF.01.37m.TDMod (2017-05-19)
- Fix for MoveZ
- Changed z-Compensation to respect positive matrix values
- Changed ZOS and M3902 to accept positive matrix values
- Changed limits for Z-Offset-Scan s Move-Z-Up/Down/Fast/Slow according to allowed positive matrix values.

V RF.01.37l4.TDMod (2017-05-19)
- cleanup
- made the function for digits compensation faster and more accurate. The digits are now measured with a higher frequency.

V RF.01.37l3.TDMod (2017-05-19)
- fixed some details
- cleanup
- New FEATURE_UNLOCK_MOVEMENT : No G1/G0 Movement allowed until one Temperature is set, one homing or some printers button is pressed. This Feature makes the change of "V RF.01.37k3.TDMod (2017-05-16)" to a real feature and prevents some bug with the menu->Load Filament function. This function used internal G-Codes and therefore the load filament extrusion was not possible until this fix.


V RF.01.37l2.TDMod (2017-05-18)
- Pause continues without E if Extrude/Retract-Buttons are used manually. This should prevent those Emergency-Blocks @Coniniue()
- Added a configuration #define Z_PAUSE_RETRACT_MM to have one place to specify the retraction mm of the firmwares functions
- linked Pause and outputObject to the Z_PAUSE_RETRACT_MMs value

V RF.01.37l.TDMod (2017-05-17)
- Testversion for automatic digit-compensation. The more force on the extruder, the more it will decrease in Z. This ist approx. 0.01mm / 1000 digits.
As we know the force on the extruder and the rate of decrease we compensate it within z-compensation. 
See http://www.rf1000.de/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=1853 :D
Maybe this is bogus -> if not it will increase the quality of thin layer prints or small nozzle prints. It might even increase the digits-stability

V RF.01.37k4.TDMod (2017-05-16)
- fixed missing translations
- removed drive-free - i really dont want and need that!
- replaced tabs with spaces

V RF.01.37k3.TDMod (2017-05-16)
- Prevent Move by GCODE (G0, G1, ...) if not homed in printer mode. This should prevent crashes when the printer resets with repetierhost still sending commands
- Fixed M3117 by changing gcode.cpp to prevent parsing text based commands alike in parseASCII(*com)
- changed standard thermistor setting back to type 3 (V2)
- removed change function of the Tip-Down-Spring-Setting within menu CONFIGURATION - Z-Configuration to prevent some missunderstanding. Now the user gets an info message how to change.
- implemented https://github.com/repetier/Repetier-Firmware/commit/371c1b709f0f3d7664e345813e84e27b591c58f4 
- rewrote some GCODE parsing functions details according to original repetier/Repetier
- changed Gcode buffer to 22 instead of 16 to test possible effects

V RF.01.37k2.TDMod (2017-05-07)
- Added better Thermistor-Comments in Extruder.cpp
- Added Generic Thermistor-Table-Function from original repetier/Repetier (in testing)

V RF.01.37k.TDMod (2017-05-07)
- This is a Test-Mod to implement Ultimakers "Bed down" for a right nozzle which can move up and down.
I made this mod to test some Tip-Down-Nozzle on T1.
M3919 T1 Z-0.6 ;das rechte Hotend reicht wenn gedrückt 0.5mm weiter nach unten.
Whenever T1 is selected the printer adds some special Z-Offset so the bed drives down a bit. This new T1-Z-Offset is respected by SenseOffset and the Z-Compensation and the Limits of the Z-Compensation as well.
- When you use M3919 the new offset is activated whenever the next switch to T1 happens.
- You can change the M3919 Z-Offset for T1 within Menu, but new values are not respected until the next Toolchange to T1 happens.

CAUTION!
This Mod is my personal Mod with my personal Settings!
#############################################################
Both Hotends are on Thermistor Type 8 = E3D Thermistor.
There is only 1mm Retract predefined within OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT_PRINT, instead of 5mm
#############################################################

V RF.01.37j.mod (2017-04-24)
- The SenseOffset will now show when it is ready to controll the nozzles height over bed. You see one character within line 3 of the Mod-Menu. Formerly there was a "@" in front of the digits limit. Now the @ will change to ^ when SenseOffset ist actively controlling within the low layers.
- The Debugging Menu is now invisible but can be activated within conriguration.h
- The RF2000 now has the right limit for its 20-char display length. Repetier-Server or Octoprint can now use additional 4 chars to display Information like date, ip-address and other.
- All the reserve pins are now listed within pins.h. This might help people who try to use the reserve connectors X25/RF1000 or X33/RF2000. Special thanks to X4r3 at this point! http://www.rf1000.de/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=1119&p=17566#p17566

V RF.01.37i.mod (2017-03-22)
- Menu fix
- Nicer menu navigation through bottom and top of submenus
- Nightly: some Cleanup

V RF.01.37h.mod (2017-03-20)
- Z_BUTTON_DIRECTION removed: https://github.com/RF1000community/Repetier-Firmware/issues/20 -> XYZ_POSITION_BUTTON_DIRECTION introduced.
- the new XYZ_POSITION_BUTTON_DIRECTION will now be 1 as default. This behavour is the same as in the original firmware.
- I did some small fixes and improvements on the Z-Screw-Levelinghelper. Now, if the Z-Offset-Scan aborts, you will get a message on the printers display to clean the nozzle or fix your z-Screw.
You will only get this special message if the z-offset-scan calculated a wrong z-Screw adjustment (Z>0)
If you look to the serial log of the printer, you can read further details about the failure and what you might have to against it.

V RF.01.37h.mod (2017-03-18 nachts)
- The hliebscher/Wessix-Bug has not been a Software-Bug, it was a missconfiguration.
#define HEAT_BED_Z_COMPENSATION_MIN_MM          float(0.33)  
is now standard. 
You should choose your startline at Z=0.35 or higher. Or place the M3909 behind the startline!
Alternative change the SenseOffsetlimit by rising or decreasing it with M3007.
- The Z-Offset-Scan will now show hints within the Repetier-Server/Repetier-Host Log how you should tweak your Z-Screw.
- #define Z_BUTTON_DIRECTION -1 will now set the orientation of the Z-Button-behaviour. See: https://github.com/RF1000community/Repetier-Firmware/issues/20

V RF.01.37g.mod (2017-03-18 nachts)
- You can now save your offset corrected Matrix through the Menu Configuration->Z-Configuration->Save Matrix to the EEPROM.
Doing this you are able to correct and save your Z-Matrix without doing a HBS. And you wont have to do M3900/Z-Offset-Scan everytime you start your printer.
If you want to work with M-Codes use M3902 Sx for this matter. x is the Matrix-Save-Position and might be {1..9}. The menu only saves to the current matrix position, the Mcode can save your matrix to every position you want it saved to.

V RF.01.37g.mod (2017-03-17 nachts)
- Added a new function: Ability to change the single step height within Position-Menu.
This Z-Step-Height is not saved in EEPROM! This could be a future feature on a users request.
- The Z-Movement is now according to the position of the button. This means: Button-Up means Bed UP. Button Down means Bed down. That behaviour should be way more intuitive. Only the professionals used to the old behaviour should be carefull.

V RF.01.37g.mod (2017-03-17)
- Bugtrace: Some little changes, percaucious volatiles, removed some "-Wpedantic"-Warnings.
 
V RF.01.37g.mod (2017-03-17)
- Z-Up and Z-Down-Buttons are now completely independend with the Position->Z-Position-Menu. 
- The Z-buttons functionality is now reduced to two states: Single_Step while Printing and Single_Move while idle.
- The Z- 1mm, 10mm, 50mm movement is only available within the Z-Position Menu.
- Whenever driving Single_Move, 1mm, 10mm, 50mm and reaching the Z-min switch it will be stopped.
- Whenever driving into -Z only Single_Step is allowed.
- driving into -Z is allowed only if your printer is homed. However you can still override this Logic by homing X only. Then Z is unlocked. This might be a future fix.

V RF.01.37f.mod (2017-03-06)
- we added a german description/readme.md
- the Z-Endstop default switch is now "SINGLE" not "CIRCUIT" anymore. This was the cause of some problems on two printers with only one endstop installed. Now this default setting again sticks to the developement/master of the original RF1000 Firmware.

V RF.01.37f.mod (2017-02-28)
- Codecleanup @M3901 M3900
- M3900 now is able to use the configuration options of M3901 directly. From now on M3901 is a preconfiguration only, the M3900 will be able to use X Y P S-Switches and scans directly.
- The buttons function for setting the digit limit now has lower steps if you set values between {0..2000} digits. This is something one might want to discuss.
Because the DMS could be under tension constantly and would therefore not have 0 @ 0 tension. But in my case (for TPE) this fine-tune-setting is better than none. Other people can still finetune their values with the correct G-Code.
- The Z-Offset-Buttons should now reach zOffset=0um, if the value is around 0um and the stepsize is != 1um. This should prevent uneven numbers when tempering with the z-Offset-buttons. Example: In case you somehow had preconfigured values like zOffset=34um, going under 0um (34um,...14um,9um,4um, -> 0um) will round to the normal steps like "5um,10um,15um..."
- M3900 is now limited to zMatrix scan positions { 2 ... Max-1 } because the real scan-positions are extrapolated to row(1) and row(max), line(1) and line(max). If you have 2 extruders or the RF2000 the scan position X=1 is still allowed, because then there is no extrapolated zMatrix-row(1).
- fixed some Y positioning bug within the ZOS mhier-Scan. The Y-Position is not shifted by ~ 10mm anymore. This bug was introduced by Nibbels and formerly caused by some `nice working` missunderstanding.
- You can now scan at random positions if you use M3900 X0 Y0. If some of those two coordinates are 0 then a random number within the scan positions limits is automatically chosen by the firmware. Wessix made this suggestion in order to prevent his special temperature sensitive heated bed to degrade at one single point.

V RF.01.37e.mod (2017-02-25)
- Fixed some +-twist within MCode M3902 Zn for better understanding and z-Offset compatibility. (Adjusting zMatrix internal offset)
- Added new Option to M3902 Zn:
If you type M3902 Z0.00 or M3902 Z0 the command will add the active zOffset to the zMatrix and turn the zOffset to zero. This adds no Offset, it shifts the Offset from the zOffset to your Matrix. You can then save your zMatrix to Position [n] with M3902 S[n].
An Offset of 1 um (micron) will typically adjust your printers hotend-V2-distance by +1°C printing temperature.
Thathow you can easily adjust your zMatrix to the printing temperature you need.

V RF.01.37e.mod (2017-02-20)
- Added better error description to mhier scan. (Text and http://www.rf1000.de/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=1674&start=10#p17016)

V RF.01.37e.mod (2017-02-16)
- Added Thermistor "NTC 3950 100k Ohm" as table 15 (good fit) / table 14 (not as good fit)
- Added Thermistor "PT100 E3D" as table 13
- Added RF2000 RESERVE_ANALOG_INPUTS=1 to ANALOG_INPUTS
- Added RF2000 reserve sensor to printTemperatures() (choosing RESERVE_ANALOG_SENSOR_TYPE 15)
- Added M3941 to show reserve temperature

V RF.01.37e.mod (2017-02-14)
- changed HEAT_BED_SCAN_DOWN_FAST_STEPS from 0.25 to 0.5mm to avoid scan aborted on 25°C-Scans.

V RF.01.37e.mod (2017-02-13)
- Increased SilentMode stepper amps for x,y by +10%
- Increased M3909's standard max offset to 180 um
- Increased M3909's max offset configuration limit to 300 um

V RF.01.37e.mod (2017-02-07)
- Fixed German Language error, thx Hobbyprinter
- Added M3920 to lower Stepper Amp (experimental noise fix)
- Fixed Display of Max-Digits within modmenu @RF1000, thx Wessix

V RF.01.37d.mod (2017-02-06)
- rearranged some Menu-Structure
- Changed the RF2000-Location for RGB-Light to ->Configuration->General
- Changed the Location of Preheat PLA and Preheat ABS to ->Extruder
- Changed other Details in Menu
- Added ZOS (mhiers Z-Offset-Scan) to ->Configuration->Z-Configuration
- The ZOS (mhiers Z-Offset-Scan) now shows the minimal Z-Matrix-Offset on the printers display in row 4 after the scan

V RF.01.37c.mod (2017-02-04)
- Left-Right-Buttons will now change the M3909 Digits-Limit on the fly, when Z-Compensation is active. This will turn the function on and off as well. (really nice feature to adjust while printing the first Layer)
- New Button_Sounds for "Mod Menu" (against Function-Mixup)
- Some little fixes and improvements
- Changed details on Feature "SensibleViscosity" -> M3939
- Added Functionality for M3939.
- Added quite undocumented M3940 for experimental use to see how a too close Nozzle affects material flow and therefore digits.

V RF.01.37b.mod (2017-01-31)
- Some little fixes 
- Added new Feature "SensibleViscosity" -> M3939

V RF.01.37.mod (2017-01-25)
- Some bugfixes
- Within the last updates the Printer got a new menu (page 2), wherein you can easily change the Z-Offset and controll the SenseOffset according your needs on the printers digital screen. This is called "Mod Menu"
- Within the "Mod Menu" you can alter your printing speed with the Extrude and Retract-Buttons.
- Within the "Mod Menu" you can alter your Z-Offset and easily push SenseOffset to your Z-Offset with the Z-Up and Z-Down Button.
[At this point I get flawless results and total controll on the first layers height! Even if thermal expansion is still happening.]

V RF.01.37.mod (2017-01-20) pulling changes to mod: https://github.com/RF1000/Repetier-Firmware/commit/fcfd9b8c11d85a5099f675351aae3502d67d1738
- On some boards the watchdog could fire during the startup of the firmware, in which case the firmware ended in an endless restart loop.
- The PWM speed for the fan of the RF1000 has been changed from 122 Hz to 15 Hz.
  - The PWM speed for the fan of the RF2000 remains unchanged at 122 Hz.
- Directly after the start of the firmware, wrong values could be shown for the current temperatures of the heat bed and of the extruder.
- After a restart of the firmware, the menu of the RF2000 could show that the 230 V plug is on although it is always turned off during the start of the firmware.

V RF.01.35d.mod (2017-01-16)
- added a new Feature called "SensiblePressure" 
It is a pressure-sense-function ment for the first layer. Wessix told me about this idea.
Syntax: M3909 P[max.digits] S[max.offset]
The printer will adjust the heat-bed if z < g_minZCompensationSteps, whenever the digits rise atop [max.digits]. 
The adjustment-offset is fixed to positive values (bed does never go closer to the nozzle than without M3909). the adjustment will not violate the [max.offset] restriction in order to avoid  unwanted offsets (not caused by too close nozzle).
When choosing [max.digits] you should already know how much digits your printer normally has (Same Material, same Temperatures) and then add some 20%+.
When the z-Compensation gets deactivated the pressure-sense-function is deactivated as well.
Use "M3909 P0" for manual shutdown of the feature, but normally this is not necessary.
You cannot activate the Feature if zCompensation is not active already.

- M3902 Z-0.02 ;will add an offset to the zMatrix
- M3902 R1 ;will now repair/smoothen the zMatrix at its lowest extrema (change of syntax)
- M3902 S2 ;will save the currently chosen (see M3009) zMatrix to "zMatrix-2" in EEPROM
- added volatile Markers to variable definitions on several variables which could be changed by an interrupt.
- see http://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/C-Volatile-Keyword

V RF.01.35c.mod
- ZOS-Bugfix
- Message Cleanup for ZOS
- Sidejob-and-Wait-Strategy for ZOS
- Included StarTonys Fan-Mod http://www.rf1000.de/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1638

V RF.01.35c
- Changed ZOS Strategy to a "switch"-Type triggered by loopRF for better communication.
- ZOS Message cleanup
- ZOS now reloads Matrix on +z-Matrix-Entry
- Fixed almost all Compiler-Warnings
- Fixed missing Init-Value für "enable" in Extruder::

V RF.01.35b
- Fix for several compiler warnings and wrong init-values.
- Fix for several //comments after #defines
- Fix for several redeclarations of #defines

V RF.01.35a
- Fix für pins.h according to rf_42
- Source: http://www.rf1000.de/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1610&p=16000

V RF.01.35 (2016-12-23) by RF1000
- In case the heat bed scan is started and the extruder is warmer than the target temperature, the firmware waits until the extruder has cooled down.
- Review of all calls to the watchdog in order to avoid situations where the heaters could remain constantly on because of a hang of the firmware.
- "Printer Ready" could be shown too early (= at any moment in the middle of the printing). Typically this information was shown only for a short moment of time.

V RF.01.33 mod_c by Nibbels
- Added M3903 S[Temp] P[s] for a stepwise HeatBed target temperature decrease

V RF.01.33 mod by mhier
- Z-Scan to compensate Offset for RF1000 by mhier
- merge of RF1000 to RF2000 by Nibbels
- Added Parameters to add offsets to existing zMatrix by Nibbels
- Added Parameter to give more weight to added near offsets by Nibbels
- Added M3902 for fixing bad headbeds with holes by Nibbels
- Added M3901 for G-Code configuration of mhier's scan by Nibbels
- fixed M116's temperature range. (@2017-01-20 pulled by RF1000 to official 1.37)

V RF.01.33 (2016-08-17)
- The emergency stop because of too high pressure values from the strain gauge stops all axes (instead of only the z-axis) now.
- At the end of the precise heat bed scan, the z-axis is moved 10 mm down before the extruder is heated up so that it is not too close to the surface.
- Successive homing of the z-axis and enabling of the z-compensation could lead to a wrong calculation of the z-position.
- Removing of the .gitattributes file in order to allow easier cross-platform collaboration.

V RF.01.31 (2016-06-10)
- Another hang of the firmware in combination with a very specific G-code has been removed.
- Minor clean-ups.

V RF.01.29 (2016-06-03)
- M303 did not update the P-value (only the I- and D-values were written to the EEPROM).
- In case the "Z Type" of the RF1000 was configured to "Circuit", the firmware could detect Z-max as hit instead of Z-min during the processing of the first layers.
- The firmware could hang or reset in case it had to process a lot of G-codes of rather short execution length (e.g. the single linear segments of a circle).
- Minor clean-ups.

V RF.01.27 (2016-05-25)
- Some unnecessary blocking of manual movements into the x, y and z-directions has been removed.
- The "Hotend Type" setting from the menu was reset during each restart of the firmware.
- There were situations where the wrong heat bed matrix could be loaded.

V RF.01.25 (2016-05-19)
- The precise heat bed scan did not determine the z offset of the heated up extruder correctly.

V RF.01.23 (2016-05-19)
- The amount of time for which the precise heat bed scan waits for the heating up has been increased.

V RF.01.21 (2016-05-18)
- The last column and row of the heat bed/work part scan did not find their way into the heat bed/work part compensation matrix.
  - Improved rounding of the x/y positions within the first row/column of the compensation matrix.
- In case both extruders were heated up before the heat bed scan, only the first extruder was turned off at the end of the scan.
- Adding of support for M3117.
  - This command can be used in order to set a status text which is not overwritten by M117.
  - M3117 makes M3110 obsolete, thus M3110 is not supported anymore.
- In case the Z-compensation is active, "Cmp" is displayed at the status display right to the current z-value.
- Adding of support for an alternative mode for the displayed z-value.
  - In operating mode "print", the menu entry "Configuration" - "General" - "Z Scale" can be used in order to determine whether the displayed z-value shall be counted from z-min or from the surface of the heat bed.
  - In operating mode "mill", the menu entry "Configuration" - "General" - "Z Scale" can be used in order to determine whether the displayed z-value shall be counted from the determined z-origin or from the surface of the work part.
- In case an error or a warning is detected by the firmware, an according error/warning information can be displayed directly at the display.
  - The status information is displayed until it is acknowledged via a button (or until it is overwritten by a following status information).
  - An eventually ongoing print/mill operation is not interrupted/delayed through a displayed status information.
  - Additional information can be provided via the log of the connected PC application (Repetier-Host).
- In case FEATURE_EMERGENCY_Z_STOP is active, the strain gauge values are not examined anymore while the print/mill operation is paused.
  - During this pause, someone might want to clean the extruder or to exchange the used tool of the miller. Such operations can bring high forces onto the strain gauge, in which case an emergency z block was possible.
- In case the z-origin at the beginning of a mill operation was not searched at the x/y start position of the work part scan, the determined z offset could be wrong.
- In case the firmware processes a long-lasting operation, it can notify an attached PC application via "busy:" packets. As a result, the PC application knows that the firmware is still alive and can avoid unnecessary timeouts.
- Adding of support for multiple (up to 9) heat bed z-compensation matrices.
  - Possible use cases are different heat bed z-compensation matrices for different beds and/or different heat bed z-compensation matrices for different filaments/temperatures.
  - The active heat bed z-compensation matrix can be chosen via M3009.
- Adding of support for a more precise heat bed scan.
  - This more precise mode waits longer after heating up of the heating bed and extruders and it determines the static offset in z-direction which is caused by the changing length of the extruder at the printing temperature.
  - The menu entries "Configuration" - "Z Calibration" - "Scan PLA/ABS" perform the scan with predefined temperature profiles for PLA/ABS.
  - M3010 can be called with the S1 (PLA) or S2 (ABS) parameters now in order to start the scan with predefined temperature profiles for PLA/ABS.
- The G-codes M3030, M3031, M3032, M3033, M3040, M3041, M3042, M3050, M3051, M3052, M3053, M3054 and M3055 are available also in operating mode "mill" now.
- G0/G1 commands are allowed to overdrive Z-min now.
  - The overdrive is limited through Z_OVERRIDE_MAX and allows G0/G1 to decrease the height of the first layer even in case Z-min is active already.
  - An example use case can appear in case the calibration line is printed with a bigger height (e.g. 0.35 mm) than the first layer (e.g. 0.1 mm) - in such a scenario, the active z-compensation could drive the heat bed upwards so that Z-min is active already.
- The mode of the movement via the "Position X/Y/Z" menus can be configured now.
  - Within these menus, the right menu button can be pressed in order to switch the mode between "Single Steps", "Single Move", "1 mm", "10 mm" and "50 mm".
  - The mode which is chosen within the "Position Z" menu is applied also to the "Heat Bed up" and "Heat Bed down" hardware buttons.
- The speed of the PWM for the fans has been changed from ~15 to ~122 Hz.
- The maximal length in x direction has been changed to 230 mm for the milling mode.
- M3006 and M3146 support the Z parameter now which allows to configure the static z-offset in [mm].
- M3007 and M3008 support the Z parameter now which allows to configure the z-compensation scope in [mm].
- The codepage of all .cpp and .h files has been changed so that also characters like ° and µ can be used without warnings from the Arduino IDE.
- Improved description of all RF-specific M-codes within RF.h.
- M3013 P1 and M3153 P1 can be used now in order to output the z-offsets from the current z-compensation matrix in [mm] (instead of the default unit [steps]).
- The firmware has sent "Start" via USB instead of "start" after its startup, which could cause problems with applications like OctoPrint.
- Single moves into z-direction via the hardware buttons could continue although the button was released already.
- Minor clean-ups.

V RF.01.19 (2016-04-04)
- Improved handling of RF1000 installations where the z-min and z-max endstops are within the same circuit.
  - The previous firmware could attempt to drive z-max free during the heat bed scan.
- The z offset from the menu was not taken over during the startup of the firmware.
- The z offset from the menu was not updated properly after the switch of the operating mode.

V RF.01.15 (2016-03-05)
- Adding of support for the following device configuration:
  - RF2000 + miller
- Direct steps into the y and z direction could cause small, unwanted steps into the x direction.
  - These small steps could cause the x stepper to buzz.
- The menu items "Set XY Start" and "Set XY End" did not set the start/end position properly in case direct movements where used to move to the start/end position.
- The driving free of Z-Max has been improved for RF1000 configurations where Z-Min and Z-Max are within one circuit.
- readIdlePressure() cancels the heat bed scan in case the idle pressure is not constant.
- After the start of the heat bed scan, the firmware waits until all temperatures are reached before it starts with the homing.
  - After the homing, the z-axis is moved down HEAT_BED_SCAN_Z_START_STEPS steps (default = 0.5 mm).
- The default homing speeds for the milling mode have been increased by about 50 %.

V RF.01.11 (2015-12-23)
- Fixing of compiler errors in case FEATURE_MILLING_MODE was set to 0 for the RF1000 variant of the firmware.
- Adding of a timeout so that continuePrint() can not block the further execution of G-Codes forever.
- Improved handling of RF1000 installations where the z-min and z-max endstops are within the same circuit.
  - After disabling of the steppers, the firmware could be unable to determine whether the z-min or the z-max endstop is pressed.

V RF.01.10 (2015-12-14)
- At this moment, this firmware is identical to the firmware from the master branch.
- This firmware can be compiled for the RF1000 and for the RF2000.
  - Switch the value for "MOTHERBOARD" within Configuration.h between "DEVICE_TYPE_RF1000" and "DEVICE_TYPE_RF2000" in order to compile the proper variant of the firmware.
  - In case the wrong firmware is loaded (= the RF1000 firmware at the RF2000 board or the RF2000 firmware at the RF1000 board), the firmware beeps 4 times after the start and does not perform any other tasks.
  - The following device configurations are supported:
    - RF1000 + single extruder
    - RF1000 + miller
    - RF2000 + dual extruder
- The following modifications apply to both variants of the firmware:
  - The displayed x/y/z positions within the display of the device are the current position (according to the so-far performed steps) now (and not the last calculated position from the queue of commands).
  - The z offset which can be configured via M3006 also can be changed via the menu now.
  - All menu entries have been reviewed.
  - A separate counter for the operating hours in operating mode "mill" has been added.
  - A service interval has been added which can inform about the amount of time which is left until the next service should be performed.
    - In case the print/mill shall be canceled via the menu, an additional question is displayed in order to avoid unintentional abortions.
  - In case the firmware shall be restarted via the menu, an additional question is displayed in order to avoid unintentional restarts.

  - The speed of x/y/z movements which are performed via the hardware buttons and via the menu has been improved.
  - In case "Unload Filament" or "Load Filament" are called via the menu and the extruder is cold at the moment, the extruder is heated up before the requested operation is performed.
  - The minimal and maximal strain gauge digits which trigger the emergency pause can be configured via M3075 Ss Pp now.
  - The status text could show "Heating Extruder" even in case the setpoint temperature after M109 was 0°.
  - The "Position Extruder" menu items could allow to move the cold extruder.
  - The two present "Position Z" menus could show a slightly different behavior when the Z position was close to the z-max endstop.
  - In case the z-max endstop is reached through a manual movement of the z-axis (either via the hardware buttons or via the menu), the z axis moves a short distance upwards automatically in order to free the z-endstop again.
  - The handling of invalid commands like "U1" has been improved so that the firmware can continue to process further (correct) commands.
  - FEATURE_CASE_LIGHT can be used in order to enable support for the case light in case there is a case light attached via the CASE_LIGHT_PIN.
  - Adding of support for M3060, which outputs the device type and the firmware version.
  - Adding of support for G80 and G81 Xx Yy Rr Zz Ff (= drilling).
  - FEATURE_HEAT_BED_TEMP_COMPENSATION can be used in order to compensate temperature drifts between the temperature sensor of the heating bed and the surface of the heating bed.
- The following issues from GitHub have been resolved:
  - #5 (after mounting of the SD card, the default menu item is "Print File"/"Mill File" now)
  - #14 (the offset of the z-axis was not set correctly after the Z-origin has been set)
  - #15, #16 (all pin definitions are within Pins.h now)
- For the RF2000 variant of the firmware, the following additional features have been added:
  - The pin definitions for the RF2000 board have been added.
  - Adding of support for the dual extruder.
  - Adding of support for three 24 FET outputs.
    - M3300 Pp Ss can be used in order to switch these outputs on/off.
  - Adding of support for three hardware PWM servo outputs.
    - M340 Pp Ss can be used in order to set the PWM interval.

    - In case the main screen is displayed, the leftmost hardware button can be pressed in order to toggle the RGB LEDs between the configured RGB mode and white.
  - Several texts and messages have been adapted in order to fit better to the bigger (20 columns instead of 16) display.
  - The SD card is detected automatically.
  - The always installed z-min and z-max endstops can be detected independently from each other.
- Additional minor improvements and corrections have been achieved during the review and clean-up of the firmware.

V 0.91.59 (2015-08-21)
- There were configurations where the milling did not continue after the search of the Z-origin.

V 0.91.57 (2015-08-13)
- Changing of the precision of the xxx_STEPS_PER_MM from long to float.
- Changing of MIN_EXTRUDER_TEMP from 160 to 120 °C (because a temperature of 120 °C can be used perfectly in order to remove/pull out the filament from the extruder).
- Adding of the AUTOMATIC_EEPROM_UPDATE, which allows to choose whether the EEPROM shall be updated directly after each change within the menu or only after "Store to EEPROM" has been called.
- Redefinition of SUPPORT_CURA to ALLOW_EXTENDED_COMMUNICATION.
  - Via this new define, all non-standard communication/messages from the firmware to the USB host can be disabled. Some applications/print servers may require to disable these non-standard messages.
- Improved configuration, recognitation and handling of the Z-endstop(s):
  - Adding of DEFAULT_Z_ENDSTOP_TYPE, ENDSTOP_TYPE_SINGLE and ENDSTOP_TYPE_CIRCUIT - these defines can be used in order to define whether only the Z-min, only the Z-max or both Z-endstops are installed.
  - Adding of UNKNOWN_Z_ENDSTOP_DRIVE_FREE_STEPS - this define can be used in order to define how many steps the RF1000 shall try to move when both Z-endstops are installed and one of them is pressed at the moment of the start of the firmware.
    - This moving allows the RF1000 to get out of the Z-endstop even when it does not know which of them was pressed.
  - In case the currently pressed Z-endstop is unknown, a homing in Z-direction must be performed before any other movement in Z-direction is allowed.
  - The type of the installed Z-endstops also can be configured via the menu (see "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Z Type").
- Homing is not allowed anymore while the RF1000 is doing a (heat bed/work part) scan and while it is searching the z-origin.
  - In addition, a homing in x and y direction is allowed only in case the RF1000 knows which Z-endstop is pressed (if any).
- Additional debug functionality has been added for the analysis of the heat bed scan and for the z-compensation.
- Calling of runStandardTasks() has been removed from moveZ() because with some G-Codes this call could cause the firmware to hang.

V 0.91.55 (2015-03-06)
- While a heat bed scan, work part scan or the finding of the origin is in progress, the following commands are ignored (except of an according log entry):
  - G0
  - G1
  - G2
  - G3
  - G28
- Sending of these commands could have a serious impact onto the ongoing scan/search because they could interfere with the movements from the scan/search.
- The ongoing heat bed scan / work part scan can be aborted faster now (e.g. through M3010).
- Fixing of a compiler error in case FEATURE_WORK_PART_Z_COMPENSATION was not enabled.
- The default value for FEATURE_CNC_MODE has been changed to 0 (= the CNC mode is not supported).
  - This change is a security measure because it is not known yet why the z-min endstops of multiple users were destroyed through after the upgrade to V 0.91.53.
  - For users which want to use the milling functionality of the RF1000 it is still possible to switch FEATURE_CNC_MODE back to 2.

V 0.91.53 (2015-02-25)
- Redefinition of prog_char in order to allow to compile the sources also with Arduino V 1.6.0.
  - This version of Arduino outputs a warning about "Low memory available" available memory, but this warning is misguided and can be ignored.
- Improved clean-up after the end/abort of a print from the SD card.
  - Previous versions of the firmware might have performed a small additional move into x and/or y-direction after the output of the object.
- In case the to-be-processed G-code from the SD card contained a non-ASCII character, the interpreter could switch from ASCII to binary - and as a result, it was not able to interpret the following G-code(s) properly.
- All micro (µ) signs have been replaced through a standard-u in order to avoid problems which occurred at some platforms.
- Removing of the support for M26, M92 and M251.
- M30 (delete file) can not be used anymore while the printing/milling from the SD card is in progress.
- Pausing via the menu of the RF1000 now works in the same way as the pausing via the hardware buttons.
- The z-compensation matrix is not loaded during the startup of the firmware anymore.
  - Instead, the z-compensation matrix is loading before it is needed the first time. This allows a significant faster startup of the firmware.
- The z-compensation works also for negative z-positions in the operating mode "mill".
- The setting of the x/y start and x/y end positions for the work part scan is more tolerant:
  - In case the new start position would be right and/or behind the current end position, the new start position is taken over and the end position is set to the same x/y position.
  - In case the new end position would be left and/or in front of the current start position, the new end position is taken over and the start position is set to the same x/y position.
- In case the current operating mode is not "print" but "mill", the firmware does not accept the commands for the configuration/reading of (heat bed and extruder) temperatures anymore.
- Improved handling of print and mill specific M-codes.
- Fine tuning of settings within Configuration.h:
  - The G-code script for the output of printed objects has been updated.
  - A separate G-code script has been introduced for the output of milled objects (see OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT_MILL).
- Review of menu texts.

V 0.91.51 (2015-01-14)
- It was possible to enable the z-compensation multiple times in case M3001 was sent multiple times in a certain order.
  - As a result, the z-compensation value could be applied multiple times because each new enabling of the z-compensation assumed the current z-position to be the not-compensated one.
- The recalculation of the current z-compensation value has been speeded up from 10 times to 1000 times per second.
  - This improvement reduces the number of z-axis steps which must be performed after each recalculation and as a result the z-axis is moved more smoothly.
- M3001 does not allow anymore to enable the z-compensation in case the home position of the z-axis is unknown.
- The z-axis correction now is being applied directly after M3001 has been sent, no matter whether another move into x or y direction has been performed already.
  - As always, the z-axis correction is applied only in case the current z-axis position is bigger than 0.

V 0.91.49 (2014-12-22)
- Adding of FEATURE_CNC_MODE.
  - When this #define is set to 2, the RF1000 can be switched between the "print" and the "mill" mode via its menu.
  - In this configuration, the additional z-max endstop can be used. This z-max endstop is connected in a circuit with the z-min endstop.
  - The default operating mode can be configured via the DEFAULT_OPERATING_MODE #define.
  - For now, it is not possible to move away from the pause position in mode "mill".
- Adding of FEATURE_FIND_Z_ORIGIN.
  - In operating mode "mill", the "Find Z=0" menu item can be used in order move the work bed upwards automatically until the current work part hits the current tool.
  - This position is used in order to set the origin in z-direction (Z=0).
  - FIND_Z_ORIGIN_SCRIPT can be used in order to configure a series of G-codes which is executed after the z-origin has been found.
 - Adding of M3006, which allows to specify the manual z-offset in [µm].
  - M3004 has been discarded (it allowed to specify the manual z-offset in [steps] previously).
- Adding of M3130, which allows to start/stop the search of the z-origin.
  - Calling of M3130 is identical to call of "Find Z=0" from the menu of the RF1000.
- EXT0_HOTEND_TYPE can be used now in order to configure which type of hotend is installed.
  - Depending to the chosen type, the default PID parameters are configured.
- Fixing of a compiler error in case CASE_FAN_PIN was set to -1.
- The minimal allowed step size for the heat bed/work part scan has been changed from 20 to 10 mm.
  - In case the minimal allowed step size is applied the startup of the firmware can be delayed by a few seconds because the reading of the z-compensation matrix needs more time.
- The additional moving operations (e.g. for the z-compensation and for the hardware buttons) have been moved from ISR(PWM_TIMER_VECTOR) to ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect).
  - The actual calculation of the z-compensation is done with less blocking of interrupts.
  - This modification should eliminate seldom communication errors (and as a result, short stops of the printing process) which could have occurred with previous versions.
- Fine tuning of settings within Configuration.h:
  - The default number of microsteps has been changed from 8 to 32.
  - OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT uses a slower z-axis speed now.

V 0.91.47 (2014-10-29)
- Adding of M3105, which allows to specify the movement after pause in [mm].
  - M3102 remains available and allows to specify the movement after pause in [steps].
- OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT has been extended so that the extruder retracts the filament after the stop of the print.
- After the heat bed scan the heating bed is moved down a little bit in order to avoid accidental collisions with the extruder during the next homing.
- In case the hardware button "Pause" was pressed during the homing of the printer, the firmware could end up in a hang.
- All heaters are turned off after the heat bed scan automatically.
- FEATURE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_POSITIONS has been set from 0 to 1 in order to allow to move all axes also when their home position is not known.
- In case the current movement after pause is bigger than the remaining distance in x/y/z direction, the printer moves until the min/max position.
  - Before this version, no movement into the according direction was performed in such a case.
- Cleanup of the delays for the external EEPROM.

V 0.91.45 (2014-10-17)
- The calculation of the z-compensation has been moved from the previously used interrupt routine to the main loop.
  - This was needed in order to avoid sporadic restarts of the firmware which occurred after the new micro step possibilities from V 0.91.39.

V 0.91.43 (2014-10-15)
- "Unmount Filament" has been renamed to "Unload Filament".
- "Mount Filament" has been renamed to "Load Filament".
- The homing-order at the beginning of the heat bed scan has been changed to the standard homing order.
- A wrong menu entry could appear at the end of the main menu (below "Configuration").

V 0.91.41 (2014-10-13)
- The automatic object output now can be configured via the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script.
  - M3104 has been removed because all of its functionality is replaced through the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script now.
- Adding of FEATURE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_POSITIONS.
  - In case this #define is not 1, the "Position X/Y/Z" menu allows to move into the x/y/z direction only when the homing position is known.
- In case the "Position X/Y/Z" menu is used in order to change the position manually, the displayed position does not change anymore when the printer has reached its minimal/maximal position.
- Additional triggers to the watchdog have been added in order to avoid rare restarts of the Firmware in combination with higher numbers of microsteps.
- There was a chance that the temperature management was disabled while the firmware waited for the continue/pause position. As a result, the real temperatures could go above or drop below the desired temperatures.
- There was a chance that the x/y/z steppers were moved while the "Output Filament" or "Input Filament" operations were in progress.
- "Output Filament" has been renamed to "Unmount Filament".
  - OUTPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT has been changed to UNMOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT.
- "Input Filament" has been renamed to "Mount Filament".
  - INPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT has been changed to MOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT.
- The speed for the unmount of the filament after "Unmount Filament" has been increased.

V 0.91.39 (2014-10-10)
- Increasing of the access delay for the external EEPROM.
  - At some printers the previous delay was too short and as a result the z-compensation values could not be read/written properly.
- Adding of the "Input Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to input new filament to the extruder.
  - INPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the input of the filament.
- Fine tuning of various settings within Configuration.h:
  - new PID values for the extruder
  - new motor currents
  - correction of a DRV8711 register for better support of higher feedrates
  - ...
- Adding of RF1000_MICRO_STEPS which allows to switch the to-be-used micro steps between 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64.
  - The default value remains at 8 which is equal to the so-far-used micro steps.
  - Most position variables have been changed from short to long in order to support also the higher number of steps.
- The format of the compensation matrix has been changed so that the same compensation matrix can be used for different micro step settings.
  - There is no need anymore to perform a rescan after the to-be-used micro steps have been changed.
- In case the z-stepper was enabled via the hardware buttons it might not have been disabled ever.
- Redefinition of the hardware buttons for the z-direction:
  - In case printing is in progress, these hardware buttons can be used in order to fine-tune the z-position. There is no automatic increasing of the z-speed in case of this mode.
  - In case there is no printing in progress, these hardware buttons behave like the "Position Z" menu.
  - FEATURE_ENABLE_MANUAL_Z_SAFETY has been enabled in order to avoid an accidental overrun of the z-min endstop.
- There was a chance that not all steppers were disabled properly during the restart/reset of the firmware.

V 0.91.37 (2014-08-25)
- The case lights were not turned on/off when they were switched via the menu.
  - Removing of ENABLE_OUT1 (this pin is used for the case lights).
- Adding of support for the case fan.
  - The case fan is enabled automatically when the extruder heater is on.

- When the SD card is unmounted, the menu item selector is set correctly in front of the "Mount Card" menu item.
- Adding of the "Output Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to output the filament from the extruder.
  - OUTPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the output of the filament.

V 0.91.27 (2014-05-31)
- Calling of "Stop Print" while the printing was paused could hang the firmware.

V 0.91.25 (2014-05-22)
- In case the printing is aborted because of any reason, also the fan is turned off now.
- In case there is a printing from the SD card going on and a temperature sensor becomes defect, the printing is aborted.
  - This functionality can be turned on and off via the FEATURE_ABORT_PRINT_AFTER_TEMPERATURE_ERROR switch.
  - A printing via the PC is not affected by this functionality and the printer continues to run in dry mode like it did until now already.
- Adding of additional beeper outputs for various changes of the printer state:
  - start/abort/stop printing via the SD card
  - pause/continue printing
  - start/abort/stop heat bed scan
- The beeper can be turned on and off via the menu "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Beeper".
  - BEEPER_MODE from Configuration.h can be used in order to define whether the beeper shall be on or off by default.
  - The beeper mode also can be stored to/restored from the EEPROM.
- Optional emergency z-stop in order to detect a possible collision (extruder against heat bed).
  - This feature can be turned on via FEATURE_EMERGENCY_Z_STOP.
  - This feature can be configured via EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MIN, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MAX, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_INTERVAL and EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_CHECKS.

V 0.91.23 (2014-05-14)
- Removing of a possible value overflow in case very big values were assigned to OUTPUT_OFFSET_Z.
- Homing of an axis always sets previousMillisCmd to the current time in order to avoid that all steppers are disabled again directly after the homing.
  - In case of an operation like "Home all" via the menu of the printer, all steppers could become disabled before this change.
  - As a result, "Output Object" could not work (because per definition, it can work only in case the steppers are enabled and there was a homing since the last enabling of the steppers).

V 0.91.21 (2014-04-28)
- Improved clean-up and output of the object after a stop of the printing from the SD card.
- Minor clean-ups and corrections.

V 0.91.19 (2014-04-17)
- Moving of the z-axis via the hardware buttons supports acceleration and allows faster speeds now.
- Manual outputting of filament (via the Host software and/or via the hardware button) could cause an unwanted emergency pause.
- When the printing is paused, the extruder current is lowered now.
  - EXTRUDER_CURRENT_PAUSED can be used in order to configure the to-be-used current while the printing is paused.
  - EXTRUDER_CURRENT_PAUSE_DELAY can be used in order to configure after which time interval in status "paused" the extruder current shall be lowered.
- Output object has been changed so that it moves into z-direction first and into x and y direction afterwards.

- In case the printing via the SD card is active, the quick menu provides the "Stop Print" entry now which can be used in order to cancel the print.
- The order of the entries within the quick settings menu has been changed.
- Stopping of the print via the menu now also disables all heaters, outputs the object and disables all steppers.
  - All steppers are disabled also after a manual "Output Object".
- Improved initialization of the display.

V 0.91.17 (2014-03-27)
- Correcting of the comments about the DRV8711 register settings.

V 0.91.15 (2014-03-26)
- Adding of averaging to the pressure measurement for the emergency pause.
  - EMERGENCY_PAUSE_INTERVAL can be used in order to configure the interval at which the emergency pause functionality shall determine the current pressure
